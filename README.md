## Introduction
This project was a brief one-week sprint where our team completed an MVP for a feature-rich mobile application. The scale and necessary features were dictated by our client - effective and intuitive UI for finding and purchasing products, managing listings and personal information, rating sellers, messaging other users, dark mode, and admin priveleges for banning users.

## Features
* Sign In / Sign Up
* Market Place
* Profile
---
The app offers two distinct profile screens -

User Profile, wherein the user can update their personal information, adjust settings, contact Superbox, and quickly navigate to their Messages, Listings, Purchases, or Public Profile.

Public Profile, which displays the user's profile as it will be seen by other users, including the options to message the displayed user, find other users, or ban the displayed user (when the current user is logged in as admin).

Under the hood, the user information (once it is retrieved from the API after a successful login or profile creation) is held in state in App.js, and distibuted to other components via useContext. When a new user's public profile is called for, an additional API call is made.

Navigation to the logged in user's messages, listings, and other screens, as well as edits to their personal information and settings, will make additional request to the API in order to update and retrieve information from the database.
